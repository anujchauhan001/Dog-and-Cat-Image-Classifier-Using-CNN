**Dog and Cat Image Classifier Using CNN**
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of dogs and cats. The model leverages deep learning techniques to automatically identify and differentiate between dog and cat images with high accuracy. The primary goal is to showcase how CNNs can be effectively used for image classification tasks.

Project Overview
This repository contains the code for training and evaluating a CNN model to classify images of dogs and cats. The model was trained on a dataset of labeled images, where each image is labeled as either a dog or a cat. The project utilizes deep learning libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras to build and train the CNN model.

Project Description
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained using a dataset that contains labeled images of dogs and cats. The images are preprocessed and augmented to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data.

The model uses a CNN architecture, which is designed specifically for image classification tasks. CNNs are highly effective at learning spatial hierarchies in images, making them ideal for this type of problem. The model was trained on a GPU to speed up the training process and improve performance.

Technologies Used
Python: The programming language used for building the model.
TensorFlow: A deep learning library used for training and deploying the CNN model.
Keras: An API used for building and training the neural network on top of TensorFlow.
NumPy: A package for numerical computing in Python, used for array manipulation.
Matplotlib: A plotting library used for visualizing the training process.
OpenCV: Used for image preprocessing.

Model Architecture
The CNN model is structured as follows:

Input Layer: Takes in an image of size (64x64x3).
Convolutional Layers: Several convolutional layers with ReLU activation functions are applied to extract features from the image.
Max Pooling Layers: Max pooling is used to reduce the spatial dimensions.
Flatten Layer: The output from the last convolutional layer is flattened into a 1D vector.
Dense Layer: A fully connected layer with ReLU activation.
Output Layer: A softmax layer that outputs the probability of the image being either a dog or a cat.
The model is compiled with a categorical cross-entropy loss function and an Adam optimizer.

Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

Accuracy: The percentage of correctly classified images.
Loss: The loss function value during training and evaluation.
Confusion Matrix: To visualize the performance of the classification model.
