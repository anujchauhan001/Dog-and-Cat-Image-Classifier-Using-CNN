****Dog and Cat Image Classifier Using CNN****
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of dogs and cats. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled images, using image preprocessing and data augmentation techniques to improve performance and robustness.

**Features**
Image preprocessing and data augmentation for better generalization.
CNN architecture for image classification.
High accuracy in distinguishing between dog and cat images.
**Technologies Used**
Python
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV (for image preprocessing)
